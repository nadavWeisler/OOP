=============================
SpaceShipFactory.java - Return an array of game spaceships to the main method by users arguments.
SpaceShip.java - Implements the SpaceShip class, abstract class.
HumanSpaceShip.java - Represent a spaceship controlled by the user.
AggressiveSpaceShip.java - Represent a computer controlled spaceship that follows after other spaceships
and try to fire at them
RunnerSpaceShip.java - Represent a computer controlled spaceship that try to run away from all other spaceships
BasherSpaceShip.java - Represent a computer controlled spaceship that try to collide with other spaceships
DrunkardSpaceShip.java Represent a computer controlled space ship that get one turn side on creation and always
accelerate only in this direction, also try to shield on every 9 turns and fire every 11 turns.
SpecialSpaceShip.java - Represent a computer controlled "vigilante" spaceship which try to get down only
basher and aggressive spaceships, also gain 1 health every 5 turns.

=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
In SpaceShipFactory class we create an array of all the different types of spaceships by user arguments.

There is one abstract class, SpaceShip all the other spaceships inherit her.
All the spaceships get most of their methods strait from SpaceShip but they implement "doAction" and
"toString" methods, that change between spaceships make the difference in each ones behavior.

I chose this design because it prevent code duplication and organized well.
Most of the properties and methods are shared between all spaceships so it shouldn't get
different and uniq deceleration.
Therefore this design make changes easier.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
In SpaceShipFactory we create an array of all the different types of spaceships the user choose.
The user must provide at least 2 types of spaceships from the following option:
    h - Human
	d - Drunkard
	r - Runner
	a - Aggressive
	b - Basher
	s - Special

If the user provides the wrong arguments then the SpaceShipFactory will return a null
representation of the array for the main game method.

The Drunkard space ship behavior is implemented by using random function for the turn property.

The special spaceship follow only basher and aggressive spaceships, fire at them 5 shots if
 it less than 0.1 angle units and gain health every 5 rounds.

Explaining in detail my design:

Extensibility - It is easy to create and update new spaceships. most of the methods and properties
are inherit automatic.

Modularity - Each component are mostly separated and contains lowest amount of logic as needed.

Intuitiveness and understandability - The program is well documented and contains valid and detailed
methods, properties and class names.
