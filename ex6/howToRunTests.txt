In order to run tests put the test directory path as the first argument in the configurations of tests.java. Put the the second
argument is the path to the testresults file. 

Make sure that your Sjavac.java file looks as such:

public class Sjavac {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ....Your main code that prints 1, 2, or 0 as required....
    }


    public int testRun(String[] args){
        ....Exact Copy of your code from the static main which returns 1, 2, or 0 instead of printing 1, 2, or 0.....


}


In addition, if you peformed a check to see whether or not you had an improper args length in your code somewhere make sure to put
that condition as a comment, otherwise the tests won't work (because the code receives two arguments instead of 1 from the tester).
Some files where deleted because there were no results in the testresults files, and 3 tests were deleted because there were unclear
repeats. Otherwise, its good to go! There are a total of 201 tests.
