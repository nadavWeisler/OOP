=============================
In both Locker and LongTermStorage classes I created abstract "Storage" class to prevent
duplicate code.
I chose to store my information in 2 hash maps with item type as key.
One hash map for the item objects and one for the inventory.
The use in this two hash maps gave me well organize way to store both count and Item object of
specific type.

In BoopingSite tests i tests same tests for each dataset to see that it works for each.

getHotelsInCityByRating - In this function first i put all the hotels from the given city in hash map
    with rating as key and hotels array as value. afterward i loop on each rate and sorted his array
    by alphabet order that add it to the result list.

getHotelsByProximity - Same as getHotelsInCityByRating but with distance and point of interest.

getHotelsInCityByProximity - Same as getHotelsByProximity but with city restriction.

I used "HashMap" all over the code. I used it because its accessible as we learn at the course.
